## 🌟 Hello and welcome!

Hi! I’m **Yudhis**, an aspiring **Data Analyst / Data Scientist** who loves learning and turning data into clear, meaningful insights. After completing a data bootcamp and earning my degree in **Informatics Engineering**, I’m now focused on building a strong career in the data field.

I enjoy exploring data, cleaning it, visualizing it, and uncovering stories that help people make smarter decisions. I’m a fast learner, detail-oriented, and always excited to grow through real projects.

Outside of data, I dream of building a warm, kopitiam-style coffee shop—carrying the same values I bring to work: sincerity, consistency, and hard work.

Always open to opportunities and collaboration. 🚀
