## 🌟 About Me

I’m **Yudhis**, an aspiring Data Analyst and Data Scientist driven by curiosity and the desire to build a better future for myself and my family.  
After years of uncertainty, I chose to grow through continuous learning—believing that **data can open new opportunities** and change lives.

I see data not just as numbers, but as **stories that guide smarter decisions**.  
Alongside my journey in data, I also dream of creating a **kopitiam-style coffee shop**, a place built on sincerity, hard work, and togetherness.
